# Team Progress Overview

## 1. Technical Work Completed
- Built a functional command-line version of the application
- Wrote a detailed `README.md`, including a full usage tutorial
- Created initial user stories to guide early development
- Improved repository structure for clarity and long-term maintainability
- Added future-development branches so members can work independently without disrupting main progress

---

## 2. Documentation & Reporting

### Story Decomposition
User stories were broken down into smaller, manageable tasks so each team member could independently contribute.

### Original Objective
Use Agile development and story-point tracking to understand collaborative development and prepare for a professional engineering workflow.

### Actionable Goal
Use Scrum practices to iteratively develop, measure progress, and increase team efficiency.

### Additional Work
- Began communicating with the project stakeholder to clarify expectations and gather rapid feedback
- Continued refining documentation, task delegation, and development clarity

---

## 3. Discussions & Decisions
- Decided to hold **15-minute sprint retrospectives** each class session
- Updated the project definition to make goals more measurable and achievable
- Created a **Scrum project board** (backlog, active work, future ideas)
- Chose to begin development with a **command-line interface** before building a desktop application
- Held end-of-class planning discussions to outline the next session's goals
- Ensured team alignment and accountability throughout the sprint

---

## 4. Next Steps
- Strengthen communication with users, stakeholders, and within the team
- Begin planning the transition from command-line application to a full desktop version
- Continue breaking larger user stories into smaller, actionable tasks
- Maintain Agile discipline to improve team workflow, clarity, and collaboration
